PART 2 REPORT FOR TCSS421A SPRING 2017 PROGRAMMING PROJECT
AUTHOR: ZACHARY CHANDLER, VU HOANG

For part 2, I didn't have much trouble implementing the nodes. To start with, I 
printed out the grammar file. I manually added each part of the grammar and 
identified where all the additions needed to be introduced. From there I could
just look at the marked additions and add it to the code.

The most tedius part was creating all of the new classes and writing the same 
constructors and methods over and over again. Luckily, eclipse had some utility
comands that automated some of the process, but it still took a good amount of
time to complete.

I seemed to have misplaced my test file, but I had a file with all of the
different statments operations that needed to be added.
