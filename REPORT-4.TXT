PART 3 REPORT FOR TCSS421A SPRING 2017 PROGRAMMING PROJECT
AUTHOR: ZACHARY CHANDLER, VU HOANG
;a short report briefly describing your solution for each part;


5.6:


5.7:
The classic for statement was a bit interesting to implement. It but the type
checking was fairly straightforward and so was the codegen after figuring out
how all the parts lined up. It was a very simple matter to put a label right 
after the initializer, and then it was very close to a while loop. The increment
just had to be put after the body of the loop followed by a goto the test at the
top of the loop.

5.11:
The conditional expression was very similar to that of an if statement. The big
difference was the matching of the "then" and "else" portions of the expression.
They not only needed to be the same class, but one could be a super class of the
other. So I needed to write a loop for all of the super classes of an object to 
make sure they weren't also a super class of the other expression.

5.12:


5.21:
The throw command was quite straightforward to implement. The exception
expression just needed to be followed by an ATHROW instruction. The analyzation
was also straightforward in that a type has an isAssignableFrom method which
can tell you if a given subclass is an instance of another class. So there just
needed to be a check if the given expression was Throwable.
