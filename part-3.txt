PART 3 REPORT FOR TCSS421A SPRING 2017 PROGRAMMING PROJECT
AUTHOR: ZACHARY CHANDLER, VU HOANG

For this part everything was fairly straightforward. I implemented a for
loop inside of JCompilationUnit that iterated over all class
declerations. If I had already found a public class decleration, I would
report an error.

For the second part I added a single line after the error that added the
name into the context as Type.ANY.
